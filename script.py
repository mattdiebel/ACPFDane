# This script was developed for ArcGIS Pro 2.3
# Some of the functions in this script need memory management improvements - they tend to cause ArcGIS to crash. Run one function at a time if this happens.
# Updated to ArcGIS Pro 2.7 and no longer crashes :)
# Comments between function calls are manual steps.

# Add the following layers (with the specified names) to an ArcGIS Pro project:
    # "dem" (uncut, unfilled) for ACPF buffered watershed
    # "cutLines" (culvert lines)
    # "depOutlets" (depression outlet points from preliminary analysis, if applicable)
    # "CNlow" (runoff curve number raster)
    # "gSSURGO" (version from ACPF database)
    
# Specify path to geodatabase:
path = "acpf.gdb"
